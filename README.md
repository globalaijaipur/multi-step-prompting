# Multi-Step Prompting Framework

A demonstration of how to implement effective multi-step prompting techniques with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate more focused, coherent, and useful AI responses.

## Overview

This project showcases a structured approach to AI prompting that breaks down complex tasks into a series of manageable steps. By using multi-step prompting, we can guide LLMs to produce more relevant and targeted outputs than would be possible with a single, complex prompt.

In this example, we use the OpenAI API to:
1. Identify a promising business area for AI applications
2. Discover a specific pain point within that business area
3. Generate an AI-based solution to address the identified pain point

## Why Multi-Step Prompting?

Traditional single-prompt approaches often lead to:
- Unfocused, rambling responses
- Missing key aspects of complex problems
- Difficulty maintaining context in lengthy responses
- Limited control over the direction of AI reasoning

Multi-step prompting offers several advantages:
- **Focused outputs**: Each prompt targets a specific aspect of the problem
- **Contextual continuity**: Each step builds upon previous responses
- **Quality control**: Allows validation and refinement at each stage
- **Improved reasoning**: Creates a clear chain of thought
- **Better results**: Produces more coherent and useful final outputs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-step-prompting.git
cd multi-step-prompting
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install python-dotenv openai
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

The program will:
1. Generate a business area suitable for AI applications
2. Identify a specific pain point in that business area
3. Propose an AI solution to address the pain point

## Example Output

```
OpenAI API Key exists and begins sk-abc123
Business Idea: Healthcare
Pain Point: Medical record management and interoperability between different healthcare systems
Solution: An Agentic AI system that can securely access, interpret, and standardize medical records across different healthcare platforms, automatically translating between different formats and terminologies while maintaining compliance with privacy regulations.
```

## Extending the Framework

This basic implementation can be extended in several ways:
- Add more steps to the prompting chain for more nuanced outputs
- Implement user feedback loops between steps
- Add validation logic to ensure quality at each step
- Incorporate different models for different steps in the process
- Save and analyze the outputs to improve future prompts

## Best Practices for Multi-Step Prompting

1. **Be specific**: Each prompt should focus on a single, clear objective
2. **Build context**: Reference previous outputs in subsequent prompts
3. **Control output format**: Specify exactly how you want the AI to respond
4. **Validate intermediate results**: Check outputs before proceeding to the next step
5. **Maintain a logical flow**: Ensure each step builds logically toward your goal
